# Predicting at Risk U.S. Counties
The aim of this project was to predict which U.S. counties were at risk for a further increase in covid-19 cases
after the beginning of the first wave in March-April.

## Blog
A more fun and visually stimulating description of this project can be found on my blog on [medium](https://medium.com/@darien.pmt/metis-weeks-4-6-8bcf6c95ef3b).

# The Data
Data for this project was taken from a variety of sources. Covid-19 cases & deaths data was from the CDC. Demographic data was
from the US census. Hospital data was from Johns Hopkins' in depth [real-time analysis](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map)  
of the pandemic. Other, less significant data sources were incorportated as well (such as a dataset determine which US counties
are coastal or not). All of the raw data is available in this repo.

# Determining the Target
It goes without saying that there was no predetermined label for if a county was at risk or not, so I had to define my own
criteria. A US county was defined to be at risk of if it safisfied the following:

1. At least 150 cases while observing at least one week of a 50% increase.
2. At least 100 cases while observing at least one week of a 75% increase.
3. At least 50 cases while observing at least one week of a 100% increase.

I did not want to label a county at risk if they saw an increase in cases from 2 to 8. On the other hand, a 40% weekly 
increase in cases would be quite bad in NYC, but we already know the conditions are bad there, so we wouldnâ€™t be learning 
anything new.

Code for determining the target can be found in `covid_features_and_target.ipynb`.

# Modeling
A variety of classification models were fit to the data, the most successful being Random Forest. 

## Class Imbalance
Only 4.5% of US counties were labeled to be at risk for further outbreak, so I oversample my training data to acount for this,
yielding better results.

## Parameter Tuning and Optimal Threshold
A grid search was run on on the RF model to find parameters that optimized F1. I adjusted the theshold on my find model as 
opposed to using the default 0.5.

## Results
Of the counties which were acutally at risk, the model predicted 64% of them correctly. 
An interactive map of the results can be seen on my Tableau public [profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/darien2928#!/vizhome/CountiesliketoseeincreaseinCovid-19Cases/Dashboard1).

# Conclusion
By examining the map of my results, I noticed that areas most at risk seemed to be surrounding the areas previously hit hard 
(NYC, LA, CHI etc). I decided to remove counties which had total case counts over 5000 and plot their weekly increase cases.
The results were interesting.
